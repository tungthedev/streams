# Prisma Streams SQLite Schema

This document describes the SQLite store used by full and local modes. SQLite
provides the durable WAL/control-plane tables for those modes. SQLite full mode
also provides SQLite's segment, manifest, index, schema-publication,
storage-stat, and object-store accounting metadata. SQLite local mode uses the
WAL/control-plane and local touch/live tables without segmenting or object-store
upload.
The goal is to:
- minimize custom file formats
- keep memory bounded under load
- simplify crash recovery (SQLite transactions)

This document specifies the intended schema and the invariants it must uphold.
Postgres has its own schema and does not use these SQLite tables for
WAL/control-plane, segmenting, manifest publication, search, touch, accounting,
or object-store recovery.

## 1) PRAGMAs (recommended defaults)

Set these at startup (configurable):
- `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;`
- `PRAGMA synchronous = FULL;` (safe default; allow `NORMAL` for benchmarks)
- `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;`
- `PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;` (optional; benchmark)
- `PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;` (avoid immediate SQLITE_BUSY)

Bound memory usage:
- `PRAGMA cache_size = -NNNN;` (negative means KB; choose based on RAM budget)
- consider `PRAGMA mmap_size = ...;` only if you understand the memory tradeoff

---

## 2) Tables

### 2.1 `schema_version`
Tracks migrations.

Columns:
- `version INTEGER NOT NULL`

Invariant:
- exactly one row

---

### 2.2 `streams`
One row per stream (up to 1,000,000 streams).

Columns (suggested):
- `stream TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
- `created_at_ms INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `updated_at_ms INTEGER NOT NULL`

Offsets / progress:
- `next_offset INTEGER NOT NULL`  
  Next offset to assign on append. Must be monotonic.
- `sealed_through INTEGER NOT NULL`  
  Highest offset included in locally built segments (may not be uploaded yet).
- `uploaded_through INTEGER NOT NULL`  
  Highest offset made visible/durable in R2 via manifest upload.
- `uploaded_segment_count INTEGER NOT NULL`  
  Count of **contiguous uploaded segments** (prefix), used to build manifests without scanning all segments.

WAL backlog counters (to avoid expensive `SUM(length(payload))` scans):
- `pending_rows INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `pending_bytes INTEGER NOT NULL`

Segmenting hints:
- `last_segment_cut_ms INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `segment_in_progress INTEGER NOT NULL` (0/1)

Additional columns present in the current implementation:
- Stream protocol/config state:
  - `content_type`
  - `profile`
  - `stream_seq`
  - `closed`
  - `closed_producer_id`
  - `closed_producer_epoch`
  - `closed_producer_seq`
  - `ttl_seconds`
- Retention/flags:
  - `expires_at_ms`
  - `stream_flags`
- WAL accounting:
  - `logical_size_bytes`
  - `wal_rows`
  - `wal_bytes`

Indexes:
- `CREATE INDEX streams_pending_bytes_idx ON streams(pending_bytes);`
- `CREATE INDEX streams_last_cut_idx ON streams(last_segment_cut_ms);`
- Optional composite index for candidate selection:
  - `(segment_in_progress, pending_bytes, last_segment_cut_ms)`

Invariants:
- `uploaded_through <= sealed_through < next_offset` for non-empty streams; new empty streams start with `sealed_through=-1`, `uploaded_through=-1`, and `next_offset=0`
- `0 <= uploaded_segment_count <= segment_count` (see `stream_segment_meta`)
- `profile IS NULL` or `profile='generic'` is treated as a `generic` stream; current stream creation stores `generic`
- `pending_bytes` and `pending_rows` reflect unsealed WAL rows with `offset > sealed_through`; sealing a segment decrements these counters
- `logical_size_bytes` is the logical payload-byte size exposed by `/_details`;
  it is updated on append, restored from manifests for published history, and
  can be repaired asynchronously after bootstrap if missing.
- `segment_in_progress` must be 0/1.

---

### 2.3 `wal`
The durable write-ahead log is a single table.

Columns (suggested):
- `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` (rowid; insertion order)
- `stream TEXT NOT NULL`
- `offset INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `ts_ms INTEGER NOT NULL` (ingest time)
- `payload BLOB NOT NULL`
- `payload_len INTEGER NOT NULL` (denormalization for fast sums)

Optional columns (only if needed by protocol/indexing):
- `routing_key BLOB NULL`
- `content_type TEXT NULL`
- `flags INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`

Indexes:
- `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX wal_stream_offset_uniq ON wal(stream, offset);`
- Optional for time-based ops:
  - `CREATE INDEX wal_ts_idx ON wal(ts_ms);`

Invariants:
- for each stream, `offset` is unique and strictly increasing by protocol rules.
- rows exist for offsets in `[uploaded_through, next_offset)` unless GC has occurred.

Notes:
- Do not rely on SQLite `rowid` as the protocol offset. Store the protocol offset explicitly.

---

### 2.4 `segments`
Tracks locally built segments and upload state.

Columns:
- `segment_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY` (stable identifier; matches object key naming rules)
- `stream TEXT NOT NULL`
- `start_offset INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `end_offset INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `size_bytes INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `local_path TEXT NOT NULL`
- `created_at_ms INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `uploaded_at_ms INTEGER NULL`
- `r2_etag TEXT NULL`

Indexes:
- `CREATE INDEX segments_stream_start_idx ON segments(stream, start_offset);`
- `CREATE INDEX segments_pending_upload_idx ON segments(uploaded_at_ms);`

Invariants:
- `start_offset < end_offset`
- segments for a stream must not overlap
- a segment may exist locally without being uploaded; visibility is governed by manifest.

---

### 2.5 `stream_segment_meta`
Compact, append‑only per‑segment arrays used to build manifests without scanning the
entire `segments` table. **Derived state**; can be rebuilt from `segments`.

Columns:
- `stream TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
- `segment_count INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `segment_offsets BLOB NOT NULL` (u64le end_offset+1 array; length = 8*segment_count)
- `segment_blocks BLOB NOT NULL` (u32le block_count array; length = 4*segment_count)
- `segment_last_ts BLOB NOT NULL` (u64le append_ns array; length = 8*segment_count)

Invariants:
- arrays are append‑only (no rewrites on seal)
- lengths match `segment_count`

---

### 2.6 `manifests`
Tracks current manifest generation per stream and upload state.

Columns:
- `stream TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
- `generation INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `uploaded_generation INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `last_uploaded_at_ms INTEGER NULL`
- `last_uploaded_etag TEXT NULL`
- `last_uploaded_size_bytes INTEGER NULL`

Invariants:
- `uploaded_generation <= generation`
- manifest upload is the “commit point” that advances `uploaded_through`

---

### 2.7 `index_state`
Local cache of per‑stream index state. **Rebuildable from manifest**.

Columns:
- `stream TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
- `index_secret BLOB NOT NULL` (16 bytes; SipHash key)

Columns:
- `stream TEXT NOT NULL`
- `index_name TEXT NOT NULL`
- `index_secret BLOB NOT NULL`

**Rebuildable from manifest**.

Columns:
- `run_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
- `stream TEXT NOT NULL`
- `index_name TEXT NOT NULL`
- `level INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `start_segment INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `end_segment INTEGER NOT NULL`

- `retired_gen INTEGER NULL`
- `retired_at_ms INTEGER NULL`

Indexes:
- `CREATE INDEX secondary_index_runs_stream_idx ON secondary_index_runs(stream, index_name, level, start_segment);`

---

### 2.11 `schemas`
Current implementation table (see `src/db/schema.ts`):

- `stream TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
- `schema_json TEXT NOT NULL`
- `updated_at_ms INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `uploaded_size_bytes INTEGER NOT NULL`

`schema_json` stores the serialized per-stream schema registry JSON (schema versions,
lenses, routingKey config, and schema-owned `search` declarations).

---

### 2.12 `search_companion_plans`
Per-stream desired bundled companion plan. **Rebuildable from manifest**.

Columns:
- `stream TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
- `generation INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `plan_hash TEXT NOT NULL`
- `plan_json TEXT NOT NULL`
- `updated_at_ms INTEGER NOT NULL`

Notes:
- this is the durable local record of which bundled companion generation the
  stream currently wants
- `plan_json` stores the enabled families plus plan-relative field, rollup,
  interval, and measure ordinals used by the current `PSCIX2` companion format
- schema or profile changes that affect bundled sections increment the desired
  generation

---

### 2.13 `search_segment_companions`
Local catalog of current uploaded bundled `.cix` companion objects.
**Rebuildable from manifest**.

Columns:
- `stream TEXT NOT NULL`
- `segment_index INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `object_key TEXT NOT NULL`
- `plan_generation INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `sections_json TEXT NOT NULL`
- `section_sizes_json TEXT NOT NULL`
- `size_bytes INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `primary_timestamp_min_ms INTEGER NULL`
- `primary_timestamp_max_ms INTEGER NULL`
- `updated_at_ms INTEGER NOT NULL`

Primary key:
- `(stream, segment_index)`

Indexes:
- `CREATE INDEX search_segment_companions_stream_plan_idx ON search_segment_companions(stream, plan_generation, segment_index);`

Notes:
- this is a local object catalog, not a row-level search projection
- each row points at one immutable bundled `PSCIX2` companion object
- `sections_json` records which bundled sections are present, such as `col`,
  `fts`, `agg`, and `mblk`
- `section_sizes_json` records the byte size of each binary bundled section
  payload that is present
- `primary_timestamp_min_ms` / `primary_timestamp_max_ms` store the bundled
  companion's covered bounds for the stream's primary timestamp field when that
  field is available; aggregate queries use these local values to skip
  non-overlapping published segments without fetching any companion object
- companions are published under `streams/<hash>/segments/...cix`

---

### 2.14 `objectstore_request_counts`
Node-local per-stream object-store request accounting used by `/_details`.

Columns:
- `stream_hash TEXT NOT NULL`
- `artifact TEXT NOT NULL`
- `op TEXT NOT NULL`
- `count INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `bytes INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `updated_at_ms INTEGER NOT NULL`

Primary key:
- `(stream_hash, artifact, op)`

Indexes:
- `CREATE INDEX objectstore_request_counts_stream_idx ON objectstore_request_counts(stream_hash, updated_at_ms);`

Notes:
- this table is local operational accounting, not durable published stream
  state
- counters are node-local and reflect requests observed through the current
  object-store wrapper
- request counts are exposed through `GET /v1/stream/{name}/_details`
- this is the SQLite full-mode accounting table; Postgres full mode stores its
  own request counters in the Postgres schema

---

### 2.15 `stream_profiles`
Stores non-generic profile configuration.

Columns:
- `stream TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
- `profile_json TEXT NOT NULL`
- `updated_at_ms INTEGER NOT NULL`

Notes:
- `streams.profile` stores the profile kind for cheap listing/filtering
- `stream_profiles.profile_json` stores the full JSON config for profiles such
  as `evlog` and `state-protocol`
- missing stored profile metadata means the stream is treated as `generic`

---

### 2.15 `stream_touch_state`
Rebuildable helper state for touch-enabled `state-protocol` streams.

Columns:
- `stream TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
- `processed_through INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `updated_at_ms INTEGER NOT NULL`

Notes:
- tracks how far the background state-protocol touch worker has processed the
  base stream
- rows are created only for touch-enabled `state-protocol` streams
- the table is rebuildable from stream metadata plus the stream contents
- it is not mirrored to object storage as exact state; bootstrap/restart reseeds
  it locally

---

### 2.16 `producer_state`
Local idempotence and gap-detection state for producer-aware appends.

Columns:
- `stream TEXT NOT NULL`
- `producer_id TEXT NOT NULL`
- `epoch INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `last_seq INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `updated_at_ms INTEGER NOT NULL`

Notes:
- used for `Producer-Id` / `Producer-Epoch` / `Producer-Seq` admission checks
- local-only SQLite state; not mirrored to object storage
- reset by `--bootstrap-from-r2`

---

### 2.13 `live_templates`
Runtime template registry for touch-enabled `state-protocol` streams.

Columns:
- `stream TEXT NOT NULL`
- `template_id TEXT NOT NULL`
- `entity TEXT NOT NULL`
- `fields_json TEXT NOT NULL`
- `encodings_json TEXT NOT NULL`
- `state TEXT NOT NULL`
- `created_at_ms INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `last_seen_at_ms INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `inactivity_ttl_ms INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `active_from_source_offset INTEGER NOT NULL`
- `retired_at_ms INTEGER NULL`
- `retired_reason TEXT NULL`

Notes:
- runtime helper state for fine-grained live invalidation
- not part of the stream's durable published history
- not mirrored to object storage
- rebuilt or relearned by runtime traffic after restart/bootstrap

---

## 3) Garbage collection and compaction

### WAL GC rule (safe baseline)
You may delete WAL rows for a stream with `offset < uploaded_through` **only after**:
1) the corresponding segments are uploaded, AND
2) the manifest generation that references them is uploaded successfully.

Implementation pattern:
- in one SQLite transaction:
  - mark segment uploaded
  - update manifest state (uploaded_generation, last etag)
  - advance `uploaded_through`
  - `DELETE FROM wal WHERE stream=? AND offset < ?;`

### Vacuum
- use `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` periodically (configurable)
- avoid aggressive `VACUUM` on large DBs in the hot path

---

## 4) Candidate selection for segmenting (no full scans)

Never do:
- `SELECT stream FROM wal GROUP BY stream HAVING SUM(payload_len) > ...;` (too expensive)

Do instead:
- maintain `streams.pending_bytes` / `pending_rows` counters at append time
- query `streams` table for candidates by indexed columns

---

## 5) Transactions

### Append transaction (group commit)
Within one transaction:
- create stream row if missing
- reserve offsets (advance next_offset)
- insert WAL rows
- update pending counters
- commit

### Segment finalize transaction
After building segment file:
- insert segment row
- advance sealed_through (or other marker)
- decrement pending counters
- clear segment_in_progress
- commit

### Upload finalize transaction
After upload success:
- mark segment uploaded
- update manifest state
- advance uploaded_through
- delete WAL rows below uploaded_through
- commit

---

## 6) Testing the schema invariants

Add a test module that:
- seeds random operations (append, segment, upload, crash simulation)
- checks invariants after each step
- ensures recovery logic restores invariant satisfaction
