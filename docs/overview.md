# Prisma Streams Overview

Prisma Streams is a Bun + TypeScript implementation of the Durable Streams HTTP protocol.

Use [index.md](./index.md) for the full documentation map.

Every stream has a profile.

- If no profile is declared when the stream is created, it is treated as
  `generic`.
- `evlog` is the built-in request-log profile for canonical wide events,
  redaction, `requestId`/`traceId` routing-key defaults, and automatic default
  schema/search/rollup installation.
- `generic` means a plain durable stream with optional user-managed schema
  validation.
- `metrics` is the built-in metrics profile for canonical interval summaries,
  default search/rollups, and object-store-native metrics companions.
- `otel-traces` is the built-in OpenTelemetry trace profile for one canonical
  JSON span per record, OTLP trace ingestion, trace search/rollups, and request
  correlation with `evlog`.
- `state-protocol` is the built-in live/touch profile for JSON State Protocol
  streams.
- Profiles define stream semantics; schemas define payload shape.

See [stream-profiles.md](./stream-profiles.md).
See [profile-otel-traces.md](./profile-otel-traces.md) and
[request-observability.md](./request-observability.md) for trace ingestion and
cross-stream request lookup. Use
[evlog-and-tracing-guide.md](./evlog-and-tracing-guide.md) for a practical
application-integration guide that sets up paired `evlog` and `otel-traces`
streams and instruments an app from scratch. UIs should use the explicit
`observability.request` descriptor from `GET /v1/streams` or
`GET /v1/stream/{name}/_details` to pair `evlog` and `otel-traces` streams.

This repository currently contains three server modes:

- `full` mode: a self-hosted server with SQLite WAL storage, segmenting, upload, and index maintenance
- `local` mode: an embedded single-SQLite server intended for trusted local development workflows, especially `npx prisma dev`
- `postgres` mode: a self-hosted WAL/control-plane server backed by Postgres, without segmenting, object-store upload, search, touch/live, or built-in profile side effects

All modes share the same HTTP route stack where the storage capability is
available. SQLite full mode provides the segment, manifest, index,
schema-publication, storage-stat, and object-store accounting capabilities.
SQLite local mode uses the SQLite WAL/control-plane and local touch/live
capabilities without segmenting or object-store upload. Postgres currently
provides only the WAL/control-plane capability bundle.

## Current Durability Model

Full mode today has two different durability points:

- append ACK means the write is durable in local SQLite
- object-store durability happens only after segment upload plus manifest
  publication

`--bootstrap-from-r2` rebuilds published stream history and metadata from
object storage. It does not restore transient local SQLite state
such as the unuploaded WAL tail, producer dedupe state, or runtime live/template
state.

A stream becomes recoverable from object storage after its first manifest is
published.

Not implemented today:

- an object-store-acked mode that would only ACK after persistence to R2
- a cluster quorum mode that would only ACK after a storage quorum accepts the
  write

## Status

- The publishable npm surfaces are intentionally split:
  - `@prisma/streams-local` exports `startLocalDurableStreamsServer` and its server types
  - `@prisma/streams-local/internal/daemon` exists for Prisma CLI integration and is intentionally internal
  - `@prisma/streams-server` is the Bun-only full server package, CLI, and
    package Compute entrypoint

See [conformance.md](./conformance.md) for current compatibility status,
verification commands, and known gaps.

## Security

Full server startup requires an explicit auth mode.

- Use `--auth-strategy api-key` with `API_KEY` for built-in authentication on
  every request.
- Use `--no-auth` only behind a trusted reverse proxy, API gateway, VPN
  boundary, or other authenticated perimeter.
- Treat the local development server as a loopback-only tool for trusted local workflows.

See [security.md](./security.md) and [auth.md](./auth.md).

## Prerequisites

- Bun `>=1.3.6` for the full self-hosted server and repository workflows
- Bun `>=1.2.0` or Node.js `>=22` for the published `@prisma/streams-local` package

## Quick Start

```bash
bun install

# Full server (self-hosted pipeline)
bun run src/server.ts --object-store local --no-auth

# Postgres WAL/control-plane server
DS_STORAGE=postgres DS_POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db \
  bun run src/server.ts --no-auth

# Local development server
bun run src/local/cli.ts start --name default --port 8080

# Status / stop / reset
bun run src/local/cli.ts status --name default
bun run src/local/cli.ts stop --name default
bun run src/local/cli.ts reset --name default
```

Notes:

- Full server startup requires `--object-store local|r2` and exactly one auth mode: `--no-auth` or `--auth-strategy api-key`.
- Postgres mode requires `DS_STORAGE=postgres` and `DS_POSTGRES_URL`, rejects
  `--object-store` and `--bootstrap-from-r2`, and supports only endpoints backed
  by the WAL/control-plane capability bundle. See [postgres-store.md](./postgres-store.md).
- Prisma Compute deployments from npm should follow the package-based flow in
  the top-level [README.md](../README.md#deploy-to-prisma-compute).
- Repository Compute bundle deployments can use `src/compute/entry.ts`, which
  injects `--object-store r2` for the server entrypoint and `--auto-tune` when
  `DS_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` is set. Compute deployments still need an explicit auth
  mode.
- If deploying from this repository with a prebuilt artifact, use
  `bun run build:compute-bundle` and deploy that artifact with `--skip-build`
  so worker-thread entrypoints such as `segmenter_worker.ts` and
  `processor_worker.ts` are included.
- Full mode binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Set `DS_HOST=0.0.0.0` if you intentionally want a non-loopback bind inside a trusted network boundary.
- Local mode is designed for development and Prisma CLI integration, not hostile-network deployment.
- The default local data root remains under `envPaths("prisma-dev").data/durable-streams/` for compatibility with the Prisma development workflow.

## Local Integration API

The supported package import for local development integration is:

```ts
import { startLocalDurableStreamsServer } from "@prisma/streams-local";

const server = await startLocalDurableStreamsServer({
  name: "default",
  hostname: "127.0.0.1",
  port: 0,
});

console.log(server.exports.http.url);
console.log(server.exports.sqlite.path);

await server.close();
```

The published `@prisma/streams-local` surface is built to run on Bun `>=1.2.0`
and Node `>=22`. The full self-hosted server remains Bun-only.

The local embedded runtime always applies the built-in `1024 MB` auto-tune
preset for cache and concurrency budgets. It does not enable the process-level
memory pressure guard, because embedded callers may share a larger host
Node/Bun process whose RSS is not owned by Streams.

The package smoke tests cover the local Live path under both host runtimes:

- `bun run test:node-local-package`
- `bun run test:bun-local-package`

`@prisma/streams-local/internal/daemon` is exported for Prisma CLI integration, but it is intentionally internal and does not carry the same compatibility guarantee as `@prisma/streams-local`.

More detail is in [local-dev.md](./local-dev.md).

## Full Server

The full server is started via:

```bash
bun run src/server.ts --object-store local --no-auth
```

Published CLI package:

```bash
bunx --package @prisma/streams-server prisma-streams-server --object-store local --no-auth
```

Bind control:

```bash
DS_HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=8080 bun run src/server.ts --object-store local --no-auth
```

API key auth:

```bash
API_KEY=replace-with-at-least-10-characters \
  bun run src/server.ts --object-store local --auth-strategy api-key
```

Optional flags:

- `--stats`
- `--hist`
- `--bootstrap-from-r2`
- `--auto-tune[=MB]`

Optional OTLP trace receiver configuration:

- `DS_OTLP_TRACES_STREAM=<stream>` enables the default `POST /v1/traces`
  receiver target
- `DS_OTLP_AUTO_CREATE=true` lets `/v1/traces` create and profile that stream
  as `otel-traces` before accepting spans

## Postgres Server

Postgres mode starts the same Bun HTTP server with a Postgres WAL/control-plane
store:

```bash
DS_STORAGE=postgres \
DS_POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/database \
bun run src/server.ts --no-auth
```

It supports stream lifecycle, append, read, long-poll, schema metadata,
routing-key derivation, producer state, and `generic` profile metadata through
the shared WAL/control-plane runtime. It does not support object-store upload,
R2 bootstrap, segment manifest publication, search, aggregate queries,
routing-key lexicon listing, `_details` storage/accounting fields, touch/live
invalidation, OTLP ingestion, internal metrics profile streams, or non-generic
built-in profile side effects.

See [postgres-store.md](./postgres-store.md).

### Object Store Configuration

Local MockR2:

```bash
bun run src/server.ts --object-store local --no-auth
```

Real R2:

```bash
DURABLE_STREAMS_R2_BUCKET=your-bucket \
DURABLE_STREAMS_R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id \
DURABLE_STREAMS_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key \
DURABLE_STREAMS_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret \
API_KEY=replace-with-at-least-10-characters \
  bun run src/server.ts --object-store r2 --auth-strategy api-key
```

Prisma Compute deployment from the published npm package is documented in the
top-level [README.md](../README.md#deploy-to-prisma-compute).

Repository prebuild for Prisma Compute deployments:

```bash
bun run build:compute-bundle

PRISMA_API_TOKEN=... \
  bunx @prisma/compute-cli compute deploy \
    --service your-service-id \
    --path .compute-build/bundle \
    --entrypoint compute/entry.js \
    --skip-build
```

`src/compute/entry.ts` has the same Compute argv behavior as the package
Compute entrypoint, but is intended for repository-built artifacts.

Compute demo deployment with Studio and the evlog generator:

```bash
bun run build:compute-demo-bundle

PRISMA_API_TOKEN=... \
  bunx @prisma/compute-cli deploy \
    --service your-service-id \
    --skip-build \
    --path .compute-demo-build/bundle \
    --entrypoint compute/demo_entry.js
```

That artifact starts the normal Streams server plus:

- `/studio` for the streams-only Prisma Studio UI
- `/generate` for a bulk evlog ingest page with a stream-name field defaulting
  to `demo-app` and `1k`, `10k`, and `100k` actions

See [compute-demo.md](./compute-demo.md).

Compute verification demo:

```bash
bun run demo:compute-verify --url https://your-service.cdg.prisma.build
```

The Compute verification workload uses large mixed-entropy binary rows so
segmenting still cuts by `DS_SEGMENT_MAX_BYTES` under the compression-aware
seal heuristic. That avoids needing a tiny `DS_SEGMENT_TARGET_ROWS` override
just to force cuts for an overly compressible demo payload.

## Development Commands

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run check:result-policy
bun test
bun run test:conformance:local
bun run test:conformance
```
