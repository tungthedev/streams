# Prisma Streams

Prisma Streams is a Bun + TypeScript implementation of the Durable Streams HTTP
protocol.

It provides:

- full server modes with SQLite or Postgres WAL/control-plane storage,
  segmenting, upload, and index maintenance
- a trusted local mode for Prisma development workflows
- a stream profile model that cleanly separates durable storage semantics from
  payload structure

The canonical documentation index is [docs/index.md](./docs/index.md). The
dedicated stream profile reference is
[docs/stream-profiles.md](./docs/stream-profiles.md).

## Example Implementations

- [prisma/open-chat](https://github.com/prisma/open-chat) is a local-first,
  multi-model AI chat application that uses Prisma Streams as the durable
  system of record for chat message events. It demonstrates append-before-render
  streaming, resumable reads after refresh or reconnect, per-user streams with
  routing keys per chat, and deployment of a Streams service alongside a real
  app.
- [oss.chat/tour](https://oss.chat/tour) is the guided tour for Open Chat. It
  walks through the system from prompt to durable stream and is the quickest
  way to see how the implementation fits together before reading the code.

## Deploy To Prisma Compute

Deploy Compute services from the published `@prisma/streams-server` npm package
rather than from a checkout of this repository. Create a small Compute app with
the package dependency and an entrypoint that selects the auth mode before
loading the package Compute entrypoint:

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "@prisma/streams-server": "<pin-the-version>"
  }
}
```

```ts
// compute-entry.ts
process.argv.push("--auth-strategy", "api-key");
await import("@prisma/streams-server/compute");
```

Deploy that app with the Compute CLI:

```bash
PRISMA_API_TOKEN=... \
  bunx @prisma/compute-cli compute deploy \
    --service your-service-id \
    --path . \
    --entrypoint compute-entry.ts
```

Set these service environment variables:

- `DS_HOST=0.0.0.0`
- `DS_ROOT=/mnt/app/prisma-streams`
- `DS_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB=1024`
- `API_KEY=replace-with-at-least-10-characters`
- `DURABLE_STREAMS_R2_BUCKET`
- `DURABLE_STREAMS_R2_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `DURABLE_STREAMS_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `DURABLE_STREAMS_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

The package Compute entrypoint injects `--object-store r2`, and injects
`--auto-tune` when `DS_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` is set. It does not inject auth; keep
the explicit `--auth-strategy api-key` in your app entrypoint and send requests
with `Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY`.

## Core Model

The system now has three separate concepts:

- a **stream** is the durable append-only storage object with Durable Streams
  semantics
- a **profile** defines the semantic contract of that stream
- a **schema** defines payload structure

Short rule:

- profile = semantics
- schema = structure

More concretely:

- the **stream** owns ordered append/read behavior, offsets, and durable
  storage
- the **profile** owns semantic behavior, profile-specific endpoints, and
  profile-specific runtime configuration
- the **schema** owns JSON validation, version boundaries, lenses, and
  routing-key extraction

Profiles sit on top of the durable stream engine. They do not replace streams.

Built-in profiles are implemented under `src/profiles/`. The core engine
resolves a profile definition and dispatches through its hooks instead of
branching on profile kinds in request or background processing paths.

Profile-specific behavior must live in a dedicated profile module such as
`src/profiles/stateProtocol.ts`. The supported extension model is:

- implement the profile in its own file or subdirectory under `src/profiles/`
- register it once in `src/profiles/index.ts`
- let core paths call profile hooks instead of adding `if (profile.kind ===
  "...")` checks

## Profile Defaults

Every stream has a profile.

- if you declare a profile, that is the stream's profile
- if you create a stream without declaring a profile, the server treats it as a
  `generic` stream

This means old or unconfigured streams still have a clear meaning: they are
plain `generic` durable streams.

## Built-In Profiles

Current built-ins:

- `evlog`
- `generic`
- `metrics`
- `otel-traces`
- `state-protocol`

Planned next built-ins:

- `queue`

### `evlog`

`evlog` is the built-in profile for request-centric wide-event logging.

It means:

- the stream content type must be `application/json`
- JSON appends are normalized into a canonical evlog envelope
- sensitive context keys are redacted before durable append
- installing the profile also installs the canonical evlog schema registry and
  default search fields
- the default routing key is `requestId`, with `traceId` fallback

V1 evlog uses the normal stream append and read APIs. It does not add a local
SQLite observability index, and it does not require a separate manual
`/_schema` call for the default search-ready setup.

### `generic`

`generic` means:

- plain ordered append-only storage
- optional user-managed schema validation
- optional schema-managed routing-key extraction
- no profile-owned payload envelope
- no profile-specific endpoints

`generic` is intentionally narrow. It is the baseline durable stream and the
automatic default when no other profile is declared.

### `state-protocol`

`state-protocol` is the built-in profile for JSON streams that carry State
Protocol change records and expose the live `/touch/*` API surface.

It means:

- the stream content type must be `application/json`
- the payload semantics are State Protocol records
- touch configuration belongs to the profile
- `/touch/*` exists only when `touch.enabled=true`

Schemas remain optional on `state-protocol` streams. If present, they validate
the JSON payload shape, but they do not own live/touch behavior.

State Protocol is a profile, not a schema feature, because it defines stream
semantics and profile-owned endpoints, not just JSON shape.

### `metrics`

`metrics` is the built-in profile for canonical metric interval streams.

It means:

- the stream content type must be `application/json`
- JSON appends are normalized into the canonical metrics interval envelope
- installing the profile also installs the canonical metrics schema/search and
  default rollups
- the canonical routing key is `seriesKey`
- metrics streams use the `.mblk` metrics-block family in addition to `.agg`

The internal `__stream_metrics__` stream is created with this profile
automatically.

### `otel-traces`

`otel-traces` is the built-in profile for OpenTelemetry trace spans.

It means:

- the stream content type must be `application/json`
- JSON appends are normalized into the canonical span envelope
- OTLP trace exports are accepted through `POST /v1/traces` and
  `POST /v1/stream/{name}/_otlp/v1/traces`
- installing the profile also installs the canonical trace schema/search and
  default rollups
- the canonical routing key is `traceId`

See [docs/profile-otel-traces.md](./docs/profile-otel-traces.md) for the
profile and OTLP receiver contract, and
[docs/request-observability.md](./docs/request-observability.md) for
cross-stream lookup over `evlog` events and `otel-traces` spans.

## Profile Versus Schema

What belongs in a profile:

- semantic meaning of records
- profile-specific runtime config
- profile-specific endpoints
- profile-owned indexes or projections
- future canonical envelopes for specialized stream types

What belongs in a schema:

- JSON validation
- version boundaries
- lens-based read promotion
- routing-key extraction rules
- schema-owned `search` field declarations used by `GET ...?filter=...` and
  `POST .../_search`

What does **not** belong in `/_schema`:

- profile selection
- touch configuration
- State Protocol runtime behavior
- evlog envelope normalization or redaction

The supported model is strict: `/_profile` manages profile semantics,
`/_schema` manages schema evolution.

Indexed JSON streams can also use the main read path with `filter=...`.
Filters are limited to schema `search.fields`, use the internal exact family
and bundled `.cix` companion sections to prune sealed history where possible,
and still scan the local unsealed tail for correctness. If an exact field
definition changes on an existing stream, the old exact state is treated as
stale and the read path falls back cleanly until async rebuild catches up. One
filtered response stops after 100 MB of examined payload bytes and reports that
cap in response headers.

JSON streams with `search` configured also support `_search`:

- `POST /v1/stream/{name}/_search`
- `GET /v1/stream/{name}/_search?q=...`

The current `_search` surface supports fielded exact keyword queries, keyword
prefix, typed equality/range, `has:field`, bare terms over
`search.defaultFields`, and quoted phrase queries on text fields with
`positions=true`.

Schema-owned rollups are also available through:

- `POST /v1/stream/{name}/_aggregate`

Rollups are configured under `search.rollups`, stored as object-store-native
bundled companion sections, and used for aligned time windows with raw source
scans for partial edges and uncovered ranges.

## Management And Introspection API

For stream management UIs, the current per-stream inspection surface is:

- `GET /v1/streams`
  Summary list view with name, offsets, expiry, and profile kind.
- `GET /v1/stream/{name}/_profile`
  Full typed profile resource.
- `GET /v1/stream/{name}/_schema`
  Full schema registry, including profile-owned canonical registries such as
  the auto-installed evlog schema.
- `GET /v1/stream/{name}/_index_status`
  Current manifest, segment, and async index/search-family status for that
  stream.
- `GET /v1/stream/{name}/_details`
  Combined stream summary, including `stream.total_size_bytes`, full profile
  resource, full schema registry, nested index status, storage accounting, and
  node-local object-store request counters in one response. This endpoint also
  supports conditional long-polling with
  `If-None-Match`, `live=long-poll`, and `timeout=...`, and only wakes when
  the stream head or descriptor-visible metadata changes.

`/_details.stream` is the full per-stream summary shape. In practice that means
it includes the stream head and lifecycle fields a UI usually needs for an
active stream page, including:

- `created_at`
- `expires_at`
- `epoch`
- `next_offset`
- `sealed_through`
- `uploaded_through`
- `total_size_bytes`

For a storage/cost popover, `/_details` also includes:

- `storage.object_storage`
  Uploaded bytes and object counts split into segments, indexes, and
  manifest/schema metadata.
- `storage.local_storage`
  Current local retained bytes split into WAL, pending sealed segments, caches,
  and shared SQLite footprint.
- `storage.companion_families`
  Bundled companion bytes split into `col`, `fts`, `agg`, and `mblk`.
- `object_store_requests`
  Node-local per-stream object-store request counters, split into puts and
  reads, plus a per-artifact breakdown.

That means a GUI can create streams, inspect the active profile and schema,
show current indexing progress, and edit profile/schema configuration through
the normal API surface. A charting UI can additionally use `/_aggregate` for
time-window summaries driven by schema `search.rollups`.

For an active stream page, the recommended pattern is:

- fetch `GET /v1/stream/{name}/_details`
- keep the returned `ETag`
- reissue `GET /v1/stream/{name}/_details?live=long-poll&timeout=30s` with
  `If-None-Match: <etag>`

The server returns:

- `200` with a new body and new `ETag` when events or descriptor metadata have
  changed
- `304` when the timeout expires without a visible change

## Profile API

Profiles are managed through a dedicated subresource:

- `GET /v1/stream/{name}/_profile`
- `POST /v1/stream/{name}/_profile`

Example default response:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "durable.streams/profile/v1",
  "profile": { "kind": "generic" }
}
```

Explicit `generic` declaration:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "durable.streams/profile/v1",
  "profile": { "kind": "generic" }
}
```

State Protocol profile with touch enabled:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "durable.streams/profile/v1",
  "profile": {
    "kind": "state-protocol",
    "touch": {
      "enabled": true,
      "onMissingBefore": "coarse"
    }
  }
}
```

Evlog profile with redaction:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "durable.streams/profile/v1",
  "profile": {
    "kind": "evlog",
    "redactKeys": ["sessiontoken"]
  }
}
```

To switch a stream back to the baseline behavior, set `profile` to
`{ "kind": "generic" }`.

## Storage Model

The stored profile is kept in stream metadata.

- `streams.profile` stores the profile kind
- `stream_profiles.profile_json` stores non-generic profile configuration
- `NULL` profile metadata means there is no explicit stored entry and the
  stream is treated as `generic`

This keeps storage simple while still letting runtime code assume a profile
always exists.

## Current Durability Model

In SQLite and Postgres full modes:

- append ACK means the write is durable in the active WAL/control-plane store
- object-store durability happens only after segment upload and manifest
  publication

`--bootstrap-from-r2` rebuilds published stream history and metadata from
manifest, segment, and schema objects in object storage. It does
not restore transient WAL/control-plane state such as the unuploaded WAL tail,
producer dedupe state, touch journals, or runtime live/template state.

A stream becomes recoverable from object storage after its first manifest is
published.

Postgres full-mode recovery uses the explicit Postgres mode matrix:

```bash
DS_STORAGE=postgres \
DS_POSTGRES_MODE=full \
DS_POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/database \
bun run src/server.ts --object-store r2 --bootstrap-from-r2 --no-auth
```

## Possible Future Durability Modes

Not implemented today:

- an object-store-acked mode that would batch writes and ACK only after
  persistence to R2
- a cluster quorum mode that would ACK only after a durability quorum accepts
  the write

## Current Supported Paths

The supported behavior is:

- use `/_profile` to choose a built-in profile, including `generic`, `evlog`,
  `metrics`, `otel-traces`, and `state-protocol`
- use `/_schema` only for schema validation, routing-key config, and schema
  evolution
- use `/touch/*` only on `state-protocol` streams with touch enabled
- use normal JSON appends on `evlog` streams to store canonical evlog events
- use OTLP trace endpoints only on `otel-traces` streams, or on `/v1/traces`
  when `DS_OTLP_TRACES_STREAM` is configured

Legacy compatibility branches are intentionally not part of the supported
surface.
